# TWEB Labo 1 : Mining Data in Github

This repository contains the result of the fist lab session for Antoine Drabble and Guillaume Serneels in the TWEB Course 2016-20117 at HEIG-VD. 

The project is aimed at developing and deploying an AngularJS 1 web application allowing users to explore usage statistics of github.com. The users are first welcomed by a landing page before accessing the web app.

## Project structure

### branch gh-pages : Landing Page

The **gh-pages** branch of this repository contains the landing page of the github explorer web app.

The landing page is made available using GitHub Pages an can be accessed at the following URL:

https://gsern1.github.io/TWEB-GitHubExplorer-Heroku-Deploy/


### branch master : Github explorer web application

The **master branch** of this repository contains the source code of the github explorer web app as deployed on [heroku](www.heroku.com).

To develop this project we have first created an [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) application using the [angm](https://github.com/newaeonweb/generator-angm) generator. The application's navigation relies on the [UI-Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) framework and the charts display is made possible by the [angular-chart.js](https://jtblin.github.io/angular-chart.js/) (based on [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/)) module. 

The aplication's database has been created with [MongoDB](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/). It is used to store the list of the most starred repos on github when the app is launched and to log every query executed on the feature 2 of the app.

This AngularJS application was then incorporated inside a simple Node.js app using Expess 4, and deployed to heroku, along with the [mLab MongoDB](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/mongolab) module.

Here's the adress of the heroku deployement:

The html template we're using is Future Imperfect from [html5up](https://html5up.net/future-imperfect).
